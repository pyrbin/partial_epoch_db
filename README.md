# Partial Epoch Database

Provides partial & very in-complete item data for the server Project Epoch @ `build 3466`

Data was fetched from `.dbc` files in provided custom `.MPQ's` by using [wow_dbc](https://docs.rs/wow_dbc/latest/wow_dbc/). Might post that project here aswell. Furthermore some names, stats etc. that does not exist in `.dbc` was matched and taken from previous beta infos.

Was made during a Sunday for fun, won't be updated anymore :)
